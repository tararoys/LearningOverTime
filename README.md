I am marking what I understand and what I don't understand on a github repository by highlighting the parts of the page I don't understand in red, the parts I partially understand in green, and the parts I completely understand in yellow.  I am doing this by adding css classes to span tags.  Each commit represents one or two new span tags highlighting something I'm paying attention to. 

If I put this repository up on github, people will see the raw source code.  It is extremely difficult to pick out <span class="dunno"> {{}} </span> from a forest of other html tags.  Especially when it's so easy to spot {{}} when it is highlighted in red.  

The solution? github has a way that you can preview html pages.  Take the github address of the page you are looking for.  Then prepend  https://htmlpreview.github.io/?
And github will kindly show you the page.
